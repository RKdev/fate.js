/fate/scripts:      Production code goes here



Ordinarily we would build hubot instead of keeping it in the repository. Since the production code rests inside
the hubot instance though, I'm pushing the hubot instance as well to keep things simple. There are fewer steps
to get up and running and I can pull the repo directly onto the production server
